Calibration Curve Tool for Analytical Chemistry

This Python tool automates calibration curve generation, statistical analysis, and unknown sample calculations for analytical chemistry experiments. It simplifies the workflow by providing accurate and efficient calculations compared to manual methods or spreadsheets.

Features
	1.	Statistical Analysis:
	•	Calculates the mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval for absorbance data.
	2.	Calibration Curve:
	•	Generates a regression equation in the form ￼, along with the ￼ value.
	•	Plots the calibration curve with observed data points and the regression line.
	3.	Unknown Sample Calculations:
	•	Determines the concentration of unknown samples based on their absorbance values.

Input Example

When prompted, you can provide the following:
	•	Known concentrations (comma-separated):
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5
	•	Corresponding absorbance values (comma-separated):
0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.21, 0.25

Output Example

The tool will output the following:
	1.	Statistical Analysis:
	•	Mean: 0.1520
	•	Standard Deviation: 0.0807
	•	95% Confidence Interval: ±0.1003
	2.	Calibration Curve:
	•	Regression Equation: ￼
	•	￼ Value: 0.9973
	3.	Unknown Sample Concentration:
	•	For an absorbance of 0.27, the tool calculates:
￼
	4.	Graphical Output:
	•	A calibration curve plot showing observed data points and the regression line.
